When building fortran->python, the errors:
     undefined reference to `MAIN__'
or   undefined reference to `main'
mean that you must add 'config_fc --fcompiler=gnu95' (or your choice of fortran)
to your 'python setup.py ...' invocation, and/or add '-shared' to the LDFLAGS
environment variable.


Mac OSX
-------

  + MacPorts (http://www.macports.org)
    IMPORTANT: before installing any ports, edit
    /opt/local/share/macports/Tcl/port1.0/portconfigure.tcl such that
    the line that begins with "default configure.ldflags" reads as:
      default configure.ldflags   {"-L${prefix}/lib -Xlinker -headerpad_max_install_names"}
    Also edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf uncommenting the line:
      build_arch  i386

    WARNING: Running `port selfupdate` will wipe out these settings.
    NOTE: Python version 2.7 is broken in MacPorts. Do not use it.

    If operating macports behind a proxy, edit proxy_http and friends
    located near the bottom of /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf.


  + Homebrew
    GFortran 4.8 may be broken; fetch/install from
